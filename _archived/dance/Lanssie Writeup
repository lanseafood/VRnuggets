main idea:
Showcase the movement of a dance performance through a visual light show, where the motion is represented through groups of light. 

how it works:
We took data from a flex sensor and accelerometer from each hand and arm. 
First, processing the data:
processing only the changes in movement in x y and z axis and flex data. 
for example, if changed in x and y but not z, and the changes in x was right and y was up, then we would record (-1, 1, 0). + or - 1 for the change in direction on each axis. 

for flex data, we processed the minimum and maximum values and split the movement into thirds, and processed data into groups (small, medium, and high) force. 

This processed data then went into a WebVR application, built in javascript using ThreeJS. This was a visualization of each hands and arm's movements. The two hands are each a ball of light, surrounded by smaller colorful lights that represent the movement. The for every shift in the hand movement, we shift the light by a pusle factor depending on the positive or negative direction of motion. For the flex motion, we rotate each x,y,and z direction for the whole groups and changed the scale of the particle groups as well.
